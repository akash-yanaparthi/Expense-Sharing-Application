# Expense-Sharing-Application
This application is a simplified version of an expense sharing application.

The **Expense Sharing App** is a simple tool for managing shared expenses with your friends, family, or anyone you're splitting costs with. It helps you easily track how much everyone owes, add new expenses, and settle any balances.

### Key Features

- **Create Groups**: Set up a group with your friends, roommates, or colleagues. Add the group name and invite members so you can start sharing expenses right away.
- **Add Expenses**: Add any shared expenses and decide how to split them. You can choose between equal splits, custom amounts, or percentage-based splits.
- **Track Balances**: The app automatically tracks each person’s balance so you don't have to do the math. It shows you how much each person owes or is owed.
- **Settle Debts**: Once you've added all your expenses, you can easily settle up. The app tells you what each person owes, and you can arrange payment directly.
